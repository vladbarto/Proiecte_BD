# SQL Database Project

## Description and Purpose
The project interacts with a Database (MariaDB) by using `SQL`. The database is 
managed with the help of [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/). 

`HTML` and `PHP` are used for creating the client-side interface.

## Modules
The project contains two folders (packages):  
- `Colocviu partial` -> which has the SQL queries required by the PDF file with the tasks in the same file;  
- `Colocviu final`
	- `menu.html` is the starting point
	- for each task (5.03x to 5.06x, x being A, then B) a .php file was created to keep the solutions (required by the PDF file with the tasks in the same folder) organised.
